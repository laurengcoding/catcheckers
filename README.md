Here is a random paragraph of text

this will be another paragraph


# most of markdown

## Emphasis

We have _italics_ and __bold__.

You can also *italics* and **bold**

I would use _this_ for italics and **this** for bold to increase readability.

***this*** or ___this___ for italics and bold.

## lists

* groucho
* harpo
* chico

- groucho
- harpo
- chico

1. groucho
2. harpo

<!-- ^ these numbers can actually be whatever number, they will automatically render correctly -->

## code
you can talk about variables or functions like `document.getElementById` in the midst of your paragrah.

perhaps `console.log` will help you debug/

for longer bits of code, use triple backticks:

```javascript
const hey = function () {
    console.log('heyy');
};
```
<!-- by writing 'javascript' next to the ``` it will colour the code according to the language being displayed -->
