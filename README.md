# Cat Checkers

## Game Description

Two ruthless predators.
One shared objective.
To claim victory over the other and reign supreme over the city of Purrth, once and purr all.

Two fierce diplomats, **Jeff** (a nice girl) and **Brian** (a kitten who is a boy), do battle in this highly-anticipated romp for the ages.

Who will strike first? Who will prevail? And _what is that smell?_

Only **YOU** can settle the score.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Photoshop

## Getting Started
Here is a link to the [deadly game with not a single bug](https://laurengcoding.github.io/catcheckers/)



## Next Steps

* Refactor existing Javascript code - making it cleaner, particularly in its ability to identify an opponent.
* Create a captureOpponent function, which updates the state.totalPoints of each player accordingly.
* Create a checkForKing function, which allows pieces that have reached the opposite end of the board to move both up and down the board.
* Make my <aside> visible on the right side of the page, rendering points for each player as they are earned.
* Trigger audio once a piece is moved on the board (meow).

## Emphasis

We have _italics_ and __bold__.

You can also *italics* and **bold**

I would use _this_ for italics and **this** for bold to increase readability.

***this*** or ___this___ for italics and bold.

## code
you can talk about variables or functions like `document.getElementById` in the midst of your paragrah.

perhaps `console.log` will help you debug/

for longer bits of code, use triple backticks:

```javascript
const hey = function () {
    console.log('heyy');
};
```
by writing 'javascript' next to the ``` it will colour the code according to the language being displayed -->
